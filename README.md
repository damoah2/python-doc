## Font Selection
The text in the project is displayed in the **Roboto Mono** font, with code examples formatted as follows:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("Bob")
```

## Execution and Hosting
The project is implemented in Markdown format, utilizing the **Roboto Mono** font for code-like text. It is hosted on GitHub, making it accessible to a wide audience. The markdown files can be directly viewed on the GitHub repository or cloned to a local machine for offline access.

## How to Access
To view the project, simply navigate to the GitHub repository where it is hosted. The project's Markdown files can be found within the repository's structure. Feel free to explore the pages and code examples to gain a solid understanding of Python programming.

## Expected Outcome
By the end of the project, participants should have a strong foundation in Python programming. They will understand how to write basic code, structure programs effectively, and apply best practices for clean and readable code. With this knowledge, participants can confidently venture into more advanced Python projects or explore specialized areas such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
